# Splitergoll keyboard

This dongle version of the Splitergoll keyboard is currently under development.

## Inspiration

- The [Aroum's Dongle Keyboard](https://github.com/aroumi/dongle-keyboard) is based on a **SuperMini nRF52840** as a dongle.
- The [Charlesmst's Dongle Keyboard](https://github.com/charlesmst/dongle-keyboard) is based on a **Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK Dongle** as a dongle.

## Objectives

- I want to use a **Nordic nRF52840 Dongle** as a dongle.
- I will start with a low complexity layout and keymap.

## Documentation

- A recent pull request about [**Dongle Keyboard** documentation](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1002) is pending.
- Here is the [preview](https://deploy-preview-2401--zmk.netlify.app/docs/features/dongle) of the **Dongle Keyboard** documentation.
