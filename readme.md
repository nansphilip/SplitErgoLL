# Splitergoll keyboard

This dongle version of the Splitergoll keyboard is currently under development.

## Inspirations

- The [Aroum's Dongle Keyboard](https://github.com/aroum/zmk-enki42-dongle) based on a `SuperMini nRF52840` as a dongle.
- The [Charlesmst's Dongle Keyboard](https://github.com/charlesmst/zmk-enki42-dongle) based on a `Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK Dongle` as a dongle.

## Objectives

- I want to use a `Nordic nRF52840 Dongle` as a dongle.
- I will start with a low complexity layout and keymap.

## Documentations

- A recent pull request about [Dongle Keyboard](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2401) documentation is pending.
- Here is the [preview](https://deploy-preview-2401--zmk.netlify.app/docs/features/dongle) of the **Dongle Keyboard** documentation.
